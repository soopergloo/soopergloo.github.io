                    <p id="p1">probably one of the most infamous recorded hardcore shows<br>
                    and one of my favorite bands<br>
                    probably not my first choice for a converge cut<br>
                    but god this video is fucking raw<br>
                    this song is about... breakups i guess<br>
                    how we meet and leave people<br>
                    and forget each other
                    or something like that!<br>
                    <br>
                    i actually cant mosh<br>
                    well im not incapable<br>
                    its just SCARY dude<br>
                    id probably get stomped on or something<br>
                    but also i know that thats an irrational fear<br>
                    but also like YOU NEVER KNOW YKNOW?<br>
                    nah in general the pits are super nice<br>
                    anyone there is just there to have a great time<br>
                    a better time than mine honestly!<br>
                    <br>
                    but really the best part of these sort of things are the people<br>
                    everyone's wearing an edgy freaking band shirt and they're all so freaking cool!<br>
                    the common interest of just the most abrasive music possible is pretty unifying tbh<br>
                    you are hear bc you feel some sort of connection to the music<br>
                    they are too<br>
                    there's something so liberating about it<br>
                    just not really caring<br>
                    <br>
                    about your well-being<br>
                    about your onset tinnitis<br>
                    about the way your body moves to the sound<br>
                    the noise really just carries it all away<br>
                    <br>
                    i still am going to get stomped on tho fr</p>
