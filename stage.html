                    <p id="p1">there really is nothing cooler than being 2 ft away from the band<br>
                    the noise is visceral<br>
                    you might seriously damage your hearing if you dont bring protection<br>
                    youll probably get pushed by the pit<br>
                    someone might jump off the stage<br>
                    shit i might jump off the stage<br>
                    <br>
                    this song is about... i think a lot of things. mainly anxiety maybe.<br>
                    i know this album was being made during the pandemic<br>
                    it is really good by the way<br>
                    the song really is assurance for the listenter<br>
                    scream all you want!!<br>
                    but it can feel like no one hears<br>
                    <br>
                    i enjoy the interlude-esque parts of the song the most<br>
                    i think these parts ARE the entire point of the album<br>
                    its the gray in between the noise<br>
                    listen to it<br>
                    think about it<br>
                    enjoy it<br>
                    and do the same for the noise too<br>
                    cuz it sounds freakin awesome
