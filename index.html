            <p id="preface>">
                This is a portfolio of my work for <span style="font-style: italic;">DSGN 1020: Art of the Web</span> at
                the University of Pennsylvania, which I took during the Spring 2024 semester. It comprises various works
                created in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as responses to readings assigned throughout the semester.
                This portfolio is meant to imitate the style one might encounter when reading a PDF in Google Chrome or
                Mozilla Firefox (or whatever browser one might use).
                It is also partly inspired by my interactions in LaTeX, an environment which I have become wholly
                familiar with in my time at Penn.
