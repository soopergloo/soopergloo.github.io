            well uhmmmmmmmm it sort of started as something inspired by the TeX typesetting system or even a pdf.
            as it turns out, this was a pretty boring and unexciting space to work in. <br>
            <br>
            so i pondered (as i do) and i settled for this sort of... virtual pseudo-document sort of thing. i enjoy
            its playfulness much more than the seriousness of the pdf simulator that once occupied this space.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">to move the pdf, just click and drag the icon in the top left.
                you can exit by clicking the X in the top right. you can move forward and backward using the arrows
                located at the bottom of the page</span><br>
            <br>
            otherwise, what follows is a table of contents and my works for dsgn 1020 at penn for the s'24

            <span style="font-size: smaller;">ah... touhou, my beloved. the character pictured above is SUWAKO
                MORIYA from the semi-popular, semi-niche
                series, Touhou Project. <br>
                <br>
                the ascii art thereof is the ascii-ification of that very picture! i think ascii art is very
                endearing, it is almost nostalgic to me.<br>
                <br>
                so i kind of wanted to go for a sort of... forum-signature-esque sort of creature. turns out, it
                looks pretty weird on different
                monitors and resolutions!<br>
                <br>
                the ascii itself was a selection of bird hieroglyphs, which is sort of disconnected from the subject
                since suwako has nothing to do with birds; she is more froggish if anything.</span>

        <div id="container-s">
            <span style="font-size: smaller;"> i like the colors of
                the work too; they are sort of inspired by nature, like grass and wheat fields
                sort of.
                to add to this, i am unsure of why exactly, but i heavily associate suwako with nature. <br>
                <br>
                a lot of her imagery involves snakes and frogs, and she herself is an earth goddess of sorts.
                the game she comes from is also one of the more
                nature-y entries in the series.<br>
                <br>
                retrospectively speaking, i would probably approach an ascii art a little bit different than
                what i did here. hieroglyphs are fun,
                but they proved to be unconvenient since they all vary in their character space. even the use of
                monospace proved to be
                ineffective.<br>
                <br>
                i had to tediously go through the birds, building up a system which can produce the picture
                while maintaining a consistent character space--despite my best efforts, it is little jank
                in some areas, and this is made very obvious through different screen sizes.</span>

                there was a certain point where i realized that i LOVE adding TEXT TEXT TEXT
                to these things. i don't really know why-- it's probably bc i love talking to myself
                (LOL)<br>
                <br>
                and i know that i am doing the exact same thing here and i am like... man i should
                probably deviate
                from this sort of thing. no one wants to read a novel.<br>
                <br>
                in any case, this website is meant to represent those grimy basement venues often
                associated with
                the underground of music. much like this portfolio, it provides a sort of personal
                context to this
                physical space.<br>
                <br>
                honestly for my first ever website i am still damn happy with it! it was fun to make,
                and as i continued
                with this medium, i find that i really enjoy trying to... simulate some sort of state of
                being.

                this is the class webring. we all chose to submit an image and have a single
                person
                host it all on one url. i chose the above image to represent my website
                because...
                it was easy!<br>
                <br>
                i don't think i really appreciated the webring. the readings were cool but
                the idea didn't go all the way home for me. i was much more interested in neat
                little websites on geocities (i love that early web aesthetic so much!)<br>
                <br>
                recently i came across perhaps more authentic examples of webrings and i think
                it is super neat how they persist even in today's internet. it also makes me
                think
                way too much about the internet itself!<br>
                <br>
                so much of my own life and childhood has revolved around this space, and it
                intrigues me how communities just sort of... pop up.

                insane to me
                just how RECENT the internet is because well for me it has always been
                around in my life right?
                like before the internet, what the hell did people do? chop down trees?
                wheelbarrow things around?
                i basically cannot conceive of what life without internet would be like
                because it has always
                existed for me and that is weird!!!!!!!!!!! and it is also weird that at a

                i was basically internet-free and now i can't get off for the life of me!

                <br>
                yeesh anyways! webrings really got me thinking about how people form
                communities and how these communities
                can be likened to, like, how communities are in real life and stuff its

                the main challenge of this website was to find a way to transition from one state to another permanently
                without any javascript. animation play-states ended up being a really interesting solution and i learned
                the method from a previous student's work.<br>
                <br>
                of course upon revisit, i would 1000% just do this using javascript.

            and the fact that you have to hold your click to see the info-cards is pretty clunky.<br>
            <br>
            nonetheless, i had a blast making this one, too, and alot of my later works just end up being
            inspired by things i like! fishing in games?? awesome!<br>
            <br>
            this is also the only one of my works to feature media rules. i would love to utilize it more, but
            i find it so horrendously tedious trying to get things just right on mobile and also it is so awkward
            to test for a mobile screen on my, yknow, not-cellular-device-sized monitor!<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"">also the power in my apartment went out making this and it was out for like 
            an entire week! i managed to get power in my kitchen and bathroom but oh my gosh what an uncomfortable workstation!</span>

                my first taste of javascript ever! even now, i am a little confused on how it even works.<br>
                <br>
                but man, it feels good to write code like this.<br>
                <br>
                this is again a music-inspired work. this time, rather than a place, it is a thing; the most humble
                of all physical manifestations of music, the most gnarly, the most kvlt; THE CASSETTE TAPE!!!!<br>
                <br>
                while the cassette clock is really just a generic cassette, i really had black metal in mind when making this. 
                i think it is an awesome and extreme sub genre of metal but it has such an odd history and array of characters,
                that it is best for me to not talk about it at all. but i guess it is no surprise that there are a number of
                horrible people associated with this genre.<br>
                <br>
                i like staticy noises alright! and the crushing solitude of a winter which never ends!

            <span style="font-size: smaller;">anyways, let's actually talk about the damn thing...<br>
                <br>
                there's not much i have to say actually! my favorite part was the inclusion of a digital clock 
                featured on the cassette. it communicates both that it is indeed a clock and that it moves with
                the seconds but ALSO i think it is a neat juxtaposition of something incredibly analog with 
                something digital, and it is all being represented digitally anyway!<br>
                <br>
                i thought it was neat.
