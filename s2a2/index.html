                    this thing is called a poopa. and it is from <br>

                    <br>
                    they are known to be somewhat hostile to<br>
                    those swimming near the surface, but<br>
                    they really aren't much of a pushover <br>

                    this is cirno, the ice fairy. somehow she <br>
                    has found herself amongst the aquatic <br>
                    life residing in this body of water... <br>
                    is it an ocean? it's probably an ocean. <br>
                    <br>
                    in any case, cirno is probably the <br>
                    strongest fairy. not only this, she is also <br>
                    possibly the smartest fairy. she <br>
                    understands math to the point of adding <br>
                    and subtracting fractions. which is neat. <br>
                    think about it. she's probably the only <br>
                    in this water that can do arithmetic!

                    this is a bluefin tuna. this is just a real <br>
                    fish. apparently if they stop swimming, <br>
                    they freaking DIE. <br>
                    <br>
                    that is a CRAZY existence if you <br>
                    think about it. you probably don't have<br>
                    to think about it for very long, too. like, <br>
                    yeah. i die if i dont swim. whose cruel, <br>
                    cruel idea was this?? <br>
                    <br>
                    anyways this fish is also known for being <br>

                    <br>

                    iconic and adorable blue shark plush toy <br>
                    sold and manufactured by IKEA. <br>
